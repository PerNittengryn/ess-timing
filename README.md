# ESS Timing

The payout timing of systems do not reset when a robbery has been committed. Thus, it is in principle possible to predict when a given system will pay out in the future. However, in practice, offsets regularly occur after downtime, which tend to shift the payout timing of all systems by for example 45 minutes. Thus, it would require daily calibration to keep up to date, and is no longer being maintained.
